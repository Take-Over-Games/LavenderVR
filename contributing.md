# Contributing to LavenderVR Wiki
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, be it a bug report, a feature request or content sumbission.  
In order to keep the information accessible and editable for everyone, we've chosen [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a platform for our wiki, so anyone can add to it with ease.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), thus all changes go through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the content (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository, optionally create a new branch from `gh-pages`.
2. Introduce your changes to the wiki. Use [github's markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) as a reference.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Create a pull request targeting our `gh-pages` branch.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/Take-Over-Games/LavenderVR/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Take-Over-Games/LavenderVR/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code/environment conditions if applicable
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.
