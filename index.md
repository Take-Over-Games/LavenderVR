# What is Lavender?
Lavender is a massive community-driven social sandbox game akin to games such as Garryâ€™s Mod and VRChat, but built on the latest Unity technology (Unity DOTS) allowing the game to be massively efficient with current day computer hardware, ensuring high FPS even in demanding scenarios, allowing for hasty load times & massive-scale multiplayer due to low bandwidth and CPU usage. There are no limits imposed on what you make in regards to performance, physics or scripting. If you have a game/world/prop idea you would like to create, rest assured you can make it.
